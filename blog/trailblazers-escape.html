                <p>If you’re craving a weekend escape into Karnataka’s hills and legends, Adventra’s curated treks to
                    Huthri Betta and Kaurava Kunda offered me with distinctly different but equally enchanting
                    experiences. And if you want them delivered with passion, great logistics, and memories to savour,
                    Adventra is the group to go with.</p>

                <p>Adventra is all about making adventure travel accessible, dependable, and memorable. They offer
                    expert-curated treks, eco-friendly practices, real-time updates and guides who know the terrain
                    intimately. Adventra values safety, experience, and those little touches whether it’s timing the
                    trek right, handling permits, choosing good campsites or ensuring every participant (rookie or pro)
                    feels supported.</p>

                <h2>Huthri Betta</h2>
                <p>Now more about the 2 treks I was lucky enough to be a part of in May and June of this year:</p>
                <p>Huthri Betta sits about 70-80 km from Bengaluru, a hill fort that’s part of the Navadurgas (nine
                    forts). The trail is approximately 4-5 km round-trip through grasslands, old fort walls and seven
                    stone gates, and even a cave midway. There’s a temple (Shankareswara) about halfway up, and ancient
                    ruins to explore at the top. The elevation gives sweeping views over farmland, valleys and distant
                    hillocks, especially beautiful at sunrise. The climb is rated easy to moderate, making it ideal for
                    beginners but satisfying even for seasoned trekkers.</p>
                <p>Huthri Betta is ideal if you like history and views. A moderate climb, ancient ruins and fort walls,
                    caves mid-route, beautiful sunrise vistas, and a chance to pause in tranquil valleys. The Adventra
                    team ensures the walk is well paced, guides are knowledgeable about history & flora, and safety
                    isn’t an afterthought. The conclusion of the trek with authentic local food tastefully prepared made
                    the trek even more worthwhile.</p>

                <h2>Kaurava Kunda</h2>
                <p>On the other hand, Kaurava Kunda is near Chikkaballapura, named after the mythic Kauravas & Pandavas.
                    The trek is shorter (~1.5-2 km one way), but steeper in places, with rocky sections and loose
                    stones. The twin hills (one of them often called Pandava Betta) offer dramatic views, especially for
                    sunrise or a starry night climb. Wet seasons can make the trail slippery, so timing matters. Kaurava
                    Kunda is steeper, more rugged, with dramatic rocky sections and twin peaks to explore.</p>

                <p>If you’re deciding between the two, Adventra makes both more than just treks — they become journeys,
                    with Adventra team’s personal attention and their operational excellence elevating every step.
                    Adventra ensures you’re well prepared and have an amazing experience.</p>
