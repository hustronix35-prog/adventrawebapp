                <p>Late June, while driving back from Kerala to Bangalore, we decided to take a break at the Bandipur
                    Tiger Reserve. The reserve is home to an incredible variety of wildlife, including Bengal tigers,
                    leopards, sloth bears, gaur (Indian bison), Indian rock pythons, and mugger crocodiles. It also
                    shelters more than 200 species of birds — among them the Malabar pied hornbill, Indian roller,
                    jungle fowl, and crested serpent eagle.</p>

                <p>We stayed at the Jungle Lodges Resort, which arranges both morning and evening safaris. Since this
                    was the onset of the monsoon season, the grasses stood tall and water was plentiful everywhere —
                    conditions that usually make spotting animals more challenging.</p>

                <p>Yet, just ten minutes into our drive, we were unbelievably lucky. We spotted a tigress with a fresh
                    kill, which she had dragged into the bushes. We arrived moments too late for the actual hunt,
                    catching only the tail end — quite literally — of the vanishing tigress. But what came next was
                    unforgettable.</p>

                <p>As we drove past, we watched her trying to coax her cubs to the kill. She had three — two playful and
                    one shy little cub who hung back, refusing to follow. She waited, called, waited again, then went
                    back for him. Eventually, with gentle persistence, she guided him to join his siblings.</p>

                <p>I am so glad we decided to take that detour. Among the many wonderful encounters that I have had,
                    this was one of the most magical and intimate ones.</p>
