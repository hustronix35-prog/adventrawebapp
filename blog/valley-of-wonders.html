                <p>August 2017. I am sitting in front of a cave, with one of the loveliest places on the planet before
                    me - the Valley of Flowers in Uttarakhand. As I sat there admiring the wonderful view of a valley
                    bedecked with flowers and flanked by majestic mountains, I reflected on the journey that brought me
                    here, 2500km from Bangalore, where I live. For for this particular trip, it was not only the
                    destination that was memorable but the journey itself.</p>

                <p>A random remark on a trip with my wife - 'It is possible to travel in India for 500/- a day' had
                    resulted in me accepting the challenge to prove it by taking a trip myself on that budget! I love
                    trekking, so I settled on the Valley of Flowers and Hemkund as a destination - so here is a short
                    account of the experience.</p>

                <p>So 5 days back I had taken a train from Bangalore to Delhi, in a sleeper class carriage - I think the
                    ticket costed around Rs 850/-. Now the trip itself took almost two days (44 hours) - and I had
                    negotiated with my wife to allow me to carry food from home for the train journey as well as some
                    chiki :). A word about the train journey - I will still say that if someone has time, a long train
                    ride in India with a book is one of the best ways to spend a day or two. The route from Bangalore to
                    Delhi meanders through the heart of the country and it is always fascinating to see the surroundings
                    and landscapes change as we transition from south to north India.</p>

                <p>After 44 hours I reached Dehli. A quick bite of roadside chhole batura satisfied my hunger and then I
                    was off to ISBT Kashmere Gate via metro to catch my bus to Haridwar. Long story short, I reached
                    Haridwar in the evening and then bought a ticket for a bus to Joshmath for next morning. Of course,
                    the main problem to solve was accomodation for the night on my extremely limited budget. I tried at
                    a couple of places but was told that even dharamshalas would charge 400/-. However just as I was
                    thinking maybe my best bet would be the station platform, I spotted a hotel which advertised rooms
                    for 300/-. I waltzed in and started negotiating with the statement that I'll stay in the room only
                    from 10:0pm to 4:00 am and my persistence paid off with me getting a room for Rs 250/-. And ... it
                    was a proper room with a TV and a tiled bathroom to boot.</p>

                <p>Anyway, I was off to Joshmath in a local bus early next morning. The road through Joshimath goes
                    through five river confluences and thus has some wonderful spots - especially Rudraprayag where the
                    muddy rust coloured Mandakini cascades down from Kedarnath to meet the pristine green waters of the
                    Alankanda playfully flowing down from Badrinath. I reached Joshimath at around 5pm, just in time to
                    catch the last shuttle jeep to Govindghat, which is the starting point of the trek where I spent the
                    night in a rather 'basic' room - let's leave it at that!</p>

                <p>So far I had spent around 1400/- on transportation, 250 on food and 550 on accomodation - so around
                    2200/ for 4 days, a tad over budget, but I knew that I would make it up in the trek days.</p>

                <p>A note regarding the cost of food - I had minimized the breakfast cost by buying a large loaf of
                    bread and some jam for 50/- which sufficed for 4 days - - starting in Haridwar. Even basic dhabas
                    however was not as cheap as I thought because a meal would cost around 80-100. So I ended up eating
                    at shacks where a couple of alu parathas or rajma-chawal was 50/- and hence my daily meals would
                    cost around 100/-. And yes - no tea or coffee!</p>
